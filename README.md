# Salary Prediction Data Science - Machine Learning Model.

This Data Science model utilizes a dataset with one million features on job attributes (industry, degree, YoE, etc.) and trains the ML algorithms to accurately predict the salary of new datapoints. 

It was written in Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda) and utilizes a variety of libraries, from Pandas, Numpy, to Machine Learning ones such as Sklearn and Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.

The notebook is well documented throughout the code for ease of reading. A summary will be added to this read.me upon the final iteration of this data science project as it's added to my portfolio.
